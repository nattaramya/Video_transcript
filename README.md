# Video_transcript
-->Now-a-days YouTube has wide variety of videos
that includes videos related to educational lectures and
entertainment. Sometimes it is very difficult to get relevant
information from videos with long duration and consumes more
user time. It can also lead to user dissatisfaction. To address this
problem, I came up with a solution of Video Transcript
Condenser System. The project aim is to retrieve key points
from the YouTube videos instead of watching the video till end
using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
algorithms. The system can take more than one video at a time
and generate summaries.


-->The system gets the transcripts from YouTube videos and
then these are summarized to get key points. The key points
generated ensures that they contain the video's whole
information without leaving any single point so that there is no
loss of information. The extracted summaries are easy to
understand so that users like students, researchers can quickly
grasp the information from the video without watching the
complete video which saves time and effort. When users are in
short of time there is a chance of missing some content from the
video by forwarding. With the help of the system, they will not
miss any key point.


-->The system has user-centric features: The summary length
can be chosen by the user, specified keywords by the user are
highlighted in the summary, the summaries can be downloaded,
summary's polarity is given by the system, text-to-speech
feature so that summaries can be read aloud and the audio files
can be downloaded to access them offline
